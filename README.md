This presentation is using a Polyglot Notebook. To open and run the notebook file, `customformatting.dib`, you will need to install the [Polyglot Notebooks extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) for Visual Studio Code, including required dependencies.
